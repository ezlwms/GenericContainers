/*
 A stack is a chain of nodes with the property that items can only be added or
 removed from one end of the stack, called the "top". The "push" operation
 places data on top of the stack, while the "pop" operation returns the data
 item at the top of the stack and removes that item from the stack. The peek
 operation returns the data item at the top of the stack, but does not remove
 that item from the stack. A stack can be empty.
